<h1>Crash Course in C++ Syntax</h1>

<p class=DS_P>
We have developed a set of lessons on Submitty that
aim to transition you from another programming language to C++.  These
exercises are targeted to students who've successfully completed
Computer Science 1 at RPI and learned Python, or students who earned
college credit for the Computer Science AP Test in Java, or students
who have done other formal coursework in or self-taught Introductory
Programming.

<em>All Students registered for CSCI 1200 Data Structures, Fall 2023
have been added to this second (not for credit, not for a grade)
Submitty course.  Contact the instructor if you do not have
access.</em>
</p>

<p class=DS_P>
The problems were designed by members of the teaching staff with years
  of experience working one-on-one with Data Structures students and
  highlight some of the common C++ syntax that trip up new C++
  programmers.  We recommend you read through the material and work
  through the problems during the first week or two of Data
  Structures.  However, note that <em>these exercises are completely
  optional and will not be used to compute your final grade in Data
  Structures.</em>
</p>

<p class=DS_P>
Some of these exercises are rather subtle.  You many need to study the
code carefully to spot the differences.  Carefully reading code is an
essential skill for all programmers.  If a specific problem has
stumped you, please ask a member of the teaching staff in office
hours.
</p>

<p class=DS_P>
Note: The exercises in the Crash Course for C++ Syntax
are <b><em>NOT</em></b> typical of the problems you will see on the
Data Structures tests and the final exam.  The Data Structures test
questions will not focus on "tricks" of C++ syntax, but rather on bigger
picture, fundamental concepts of Data Structures theory and practice.
