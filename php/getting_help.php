<p class=DS_P>
Your work on the homeworks and the labs for this course should be
completed on your own, following the 
<a href="academic_integrity.php">Collaboration Policy</a>.  However,
you are encouraged to ask lots of questions about the material when
you get stuck.  Please ask your instructor, graduate TAs,
undergraduate lab programming mentors, and fellow classmates for
help.  </p>

<p class=DS_P>
Don't be shy or worried if you can't always figure things out all 
on your own.  <em>Please ask for help.</em>  We're happy to give 
you hints, programming tips, and guide you through debugging.

<h2>Submitty Discussion Forum</h2>

<p class=DS_P>
Post your questions about homework and general questions on the
Submitty <a href="https://submitty.cs.rpi.edu/courses/f23/csci1200/forum">Discussion Forum</a>.  The TAs, instructor, and other students will help answer
your questions.  Be sure not to post partial or full solutions to the
lab or homework problems when asking your questions or answering a
classmate's question.  Posting a line or two of code that is causing a
compiler syntax error is ok.
</p>

<p class=DS_P>If you registered at least a week before the first day
of classes, you should be automatically added to Submitty, you will
use your RPI RCS username & password to log in.  Contact the
instructor if you cannot access Submitty.

<h2>Instructor & TA Office Hours</h2>


<p class=DS_P>
A very important resource for help outside of class are the instructor
and TA office hours.  You may attend the office hours of any other TA
(not just your lab TA) for questions about the course material or the
homework.  If you have questions about the grading of your homework,
please see the TA who graded your assignment during their regular
office hours or make an appointment.
</p>

<ul class=DS_UL> 
<li class=DS_LI> 
<p class=DS_P> <a href="schedule.php">Weekly Office Hours Schedule</a>
<br> Office hours get very busy as the deadline approaches.  Start the
homework early and take advantage of the less crowded office hours
early in the week.
</p>

<li class=DS_LI>
<p class=DS_P>
<a href="index.php">Instructor & TA Contact Information</a>
<br>
Short questions about confidential matters over email are ok.  But
please come see us in office hours for more involved
questions.  <em>Please do not email your homework assignment to the
instructor or TAs.</em>  We can login and view your submitted homework
files if you encounter a problem at submission time and have a short
question related to homework submission.
</p>
