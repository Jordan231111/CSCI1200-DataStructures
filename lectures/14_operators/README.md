# Lecture 14 --- Problem Solving Techniques

- Operators as non-member functions, as member functions, and as friend functions.

## 14.1 Complex Numbers — A Brief Review

- Complex numbers take the form z = a + bi, where i =
√
−1 and a and b are real. a is called the real part, b is
called the imaginary part.
- If w = c + di, then
– w + z = (a + c) + (b + d)i,
– w − z = (a − c) + (b − d)i, and
– w × z = (ac − bd) + (ad + bc)i
- The magnitude of a complex number is √
a
