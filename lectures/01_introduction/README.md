### Transitioning from Python to C++ (from CSCI-1100 Computer Science 1)

- Python is a great language to learn the power and flexibility of programming and computational problem solving.  This semester we will work in C++ and study lower level programming concepts, focusing on details including efficiency and memory usage.
- Outside of this class, when working on large programming projects, you will find it is not uncommon to use a mix of programming languages and libraries.  The individual advantages of Python and C++ (and Java, and Perl, and C, and UNIX bash scripts, and ... ) can be combined into an elegant (or terrifyingly complex) masterpiece.
