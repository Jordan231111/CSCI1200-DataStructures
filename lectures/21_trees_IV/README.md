## 21.1 Red-Black Trees
In addition to the binary search tree properties, the following 
red-black tree properties are maintained throughout all 
modifications to the data structure:

- Each node is either red or black.
- The NULL child pointers are black.
- Both children of every red node are black.
- Thus, the parent of a red node must also be black.
- All paths from a particular node to a NULL child pointer contain the same
  number of black nodes.

What tree does our **ds_set** implementation produce if we insert the
numbers 1-14 **in order**?

The tree at the right is the result using a red-black tree.  Notice how the tree is still quite balanced.

## Exercise 21.2
Fill in the tree on the right with the integers 1-7 to make a binary search tree.  Also, color each node "red" or "black" so that the tree also fulfills the requirements of a Red-Black tree.

Which nodes are red?

**Note:** Red-Black Trees are just one algorithm for **self-balancing binary search tress**. We have many more, including the AVL trees that we discussed last week.

## Trinary Tree

A  **trinary tree** is similar to a binary tree except that each node has at most 3 children.  Write a **recursive** function named **EqualsChildrenSum** that takes one argument, a pointer to the root of a trinary tree, and returns true if the value at each non-leaf node is the sum of the values of all of its children and false otherwise.  In
the examples below, the tree on the left will return true and the tree on the right will return false.

```cpp
class Node {
  public:
    int value;
    Node* left;
    Node* middle;
    Node* right;
  };
```
