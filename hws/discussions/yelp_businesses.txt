In-class discussion

Discuss the following questions with students around you.

1. The last command line argument (i.e., categories) may contain one or more words, how does our program know how many words are provided in the categories argument?

2. In our program, how do we determine if a business falls into the chosen categories or not?
3. Since the homework spec requires us to store the matching businesses in a linked list, is std::vector still a good choice for any part of the program?

4. Is it necessary to store every field of each line into some data structure or some class object?
5. Is it neceesary to check the categories field of every line?

6. Do we need call a sort function? The std::list container does have a sort member function.
7. Do we need to implement a destructor for the class we write? Is heap memory a good choice to store the linked list?
