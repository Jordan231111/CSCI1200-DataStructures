In-class discussion

Discuss the following questions with students around you.

1. When defining the driver and rider classes, how many constructors do we need to define for each class? Do we have to define the default constructor?
2. Do we need to define a destructor for the driver or rider class?
3. Do we need a getter/setter for each of the member variables?

4. What should the main function do?
5. What should we do when the command is "request"?
6. What should we do when the command is "cancel"?
7. When to open and when to close the 2 inputs files and the 3 output files?

8. When a driver cancels a request, your program tries to find another driver who is the closest to the rider, what if that driver is the same driver as the one who is canceling?
