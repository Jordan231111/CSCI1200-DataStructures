# Homework 5 — Design and Implementation of a Simple Tinder

In this assignment you will develop a simple online dating application which mimics some of the features provided by Tinder. Please read the entire handout before starting to code the assignment.

## Learning Objectives

- Get familiar with a commonly used data structure - linked lists.
- Practice creating and manipulating linked lists without using the std::list library.

## Background

Tinder allows users to view other users' profiles, and users can swipe right or swipe left. Swipe right means like or accept someone, whereas swipe left means reject them. When two users both express interest by swiping right, the app establishes a match between them, allowing them to initiate conversations and interact further.

In addition, users will only see nearby users, and they can filter whom they want to see, based on age, height, and distance.

In this assignment you will be implementing these two features.

## Specification

To be added.

## Program Requirements & Submission Details

Use good coding style when you design and implement your program. Organize your program into functions:
don’t put all the code in main! Be sure to read the [Homework Policies](https://www.cs.rpi.edu/academics/courses/fall23/csci1200/homework_policies.php) as you put the finishing touches on your solution. Be sure to make up new test cases to fully debug your program and don’t forget
to comment your code! Use the provided template [README.txt](./README.txt) file for notes you want the grader to read.
You must do this assignment on your own, as described in the [Collaboration Policy & Academic Integrity](https://www.cs.rpi.edu/academics/courses/fall23/csci1200/academic_integrity.php) page. If you did discuss the problem or error messages, etc. with anyone, please list their names in your
README.txt file.
